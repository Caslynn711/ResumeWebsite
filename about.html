    <p>A little bit about me...My name is Cassie and I am a mom to 3 beautiful children. They are my
        life and everything I do is for them. They definitely bring excitement into my life and challenge
        me to become my best self. Without them I don't know where I'd be. They saved me.
        Born and raised in NYC, I moved to Florida at the age of 16. Currently I am in school 
        pursing my Bachelors in Management and Tech Development, with an expected graduation date
        of June 2025. Along with studying for my Bachelors, I am self studying to become a fullstack 
        software engineer, currently taking Udemy courses. I received a computer programming certificate
        from St. Petersberg College in 2019. I would say my love of coding began in 2007 during the myspace
        age. At the time I did not know I was coding, but I remember loving altering the html and css code of 
        my myspace page. When I first began college my goal was to become a physician's assistant, however,
        I realized I did not love or have a passion for the medical field. Once I realized coding was my actual love,
        I decided to change majors in 2017. My favorite languages to date are Java (my first love), JavaScript and 
        Python. I'm still on my journey into the tech world, but it has taught me so much about the future and myself
        in the process that I wouldn't change my path for anything else in the world. To learn a little bit more about
        me and my all time favorite hobbies, click the link below! Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a little 
        bit about me.
