    <h1>My Favorite Hobbies</h1>
    <h3>The Gym</h3>
    <p>I am a total gym rat. I love the fact that my body is like a 
        huge science expeiment that I can change and build into what 
        I want. I also love the feeling of strength going to the gym
        creates for me. It's literally the only place I feel in control.
    </p>

    <h3>Books</h3>
    <p>I've always been a daydreamer. There's nothing like escaping into a world
        your mind has created when needed. Books take me there. I have a love for all things
        fiction (specifically sci-fi) and auto biographies. You can't go wrong with a good book.

    <h3>Going to the Movies</h3>
    <p>I don't know what it is that's so exciting about going to see a movie at the theatre.
        It's a past time me and my dad used to enjoy when I was a child and it's certainly become 
        something I just love to do as an adult. It reminds me of my dad.

    <h3>Traveling</h3>
    <p>Seeing the world and all of the wonderful cultures it inhabits is the most amazing thing to Experience
        in life. I am an avid learner and seeker of knowledge. My dream in life is to see the world and learn 
        all that I can about the people who I share this planet with. There are wonders out there and to be able
        to experience them is truly a blessing.

    <h3>Creating</h3>
    <p>Last but definitely not least is creaing. I love to create. Whether it be a website, application, social media 
        content, video editing, etc. To be able to create and breathe life into something you've dreamed up in your mind's 
        eye is the most sastisfying and rewarding experience. As long as I have the ability to create, I will always feel alive.
